# Al Madad Trust â€” Rayadurg (React + Vite + Tailwind starter)

This is a starter project (Vite + React + Tailwind) for the Al Madad Trust Rayadurg website.
It's configured to be deployed on Vercel.

## How to use (mobile-friendly flow)
1. Download and unzip the project on your device.
2. Upload files to a new GitHub repository (use GitHub website/app).
   - If uploading many files on mobile is difficult, use the GitHub web UI 'Create new file' to paste key files and add others later.
3. On Vercel: Import the GitHub repository.
   - Vercel will detect the project and run `npm run build`.
   - Output directory for Vite is `dist` (Vercel auto-detects).
4. After deployment you will get a live URL.

## Local development (optional)
- Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` (requires Node.js on your machine).

## Replace placeholders
- Replace `public/logo.png`, contact details, and bank/donate info before making the site public.
